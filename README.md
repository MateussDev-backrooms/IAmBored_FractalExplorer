# Fractal explorer
not the most user friendly tool, but it is a simple fractal explorer
you can box select an area you want to be zoomed in and then after some work (js is single-threaded) it will render that part
if the area looks like blobs increase the *iteration count* and if you feel like the image it too pixely change the *resolution* (this massively increases time u have to wait before it renders an area you zoomed into)
